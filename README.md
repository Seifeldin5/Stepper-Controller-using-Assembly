# Stepper-Driver-using-Assembly
Project Description:
-Stepper motor is a brushless DC motor that divides the full rotation angle of 360Â° into a number of equal steps.
-The motor is rotated by applying a certain sequence of control signals. 
-The speed of rotation can be changed by changing the rate at which the control signals are applied.
-Various stepper motors with different step angles and torque ratings are available in the market.
-A microcontroller can be used to apply different control signals to the motor to make it rotate according to the need of the application.
