## Quick start

- in order to run the [circuit](https://github.com/seif-1999/Stepper-Controller-using-Assembly) you have to install at least proteus version 7. 
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/seif-1999/Stepper-Controller-using-Assembly.git`


## Project Description:
-Stepper motor is a brushless DC motor that divides the full rotation angle of 360째 into a number of equal steps.
-The motor is rotated by applying a certain sequence of control signals. 
-The speed of rotation can be changed by changing the rate at which the control signals are applied.
-The rotation angle is controlled by the potentiometer.
-Various stepper motors with different step angles and torque ratings are available in the market.
-A microcontroller can be used to apply different control signals to the motor to make it rotate according to the need of the application.

## Components discription
### Stepper motor
<img src="STEPPER MOTOR.png" align="right" >
<div style="display:inline-block; ">
  <span style="width:74%;float:left; display:inline-block;">
<p>
  - DC motor that move in discrete steps giving the illusion of rotation </br>
  - It devides the complete rotation into number of steps ,Each stepper motor will have fixed step      angle</br>
  - this motor is drived by L293D Motor Driver</br>
  -stepper motor are basically two types :Unipolar & bipolar
  <ul>
    <li><h5>unipolar :- </h5> has 5 or 6 wires ,this happens by tying each 2 coils from one end 
then there are 2 common wires as shown  , unipolar can be used as bipolar 
as we did in the project. </li>
  <li><h5>Bipolar :- </h5> has only 4 wires comming out from two coils ,there is no common wires , it can't be used as unipolar </li>
  </ul>

<p>
  -ATmega32 is a powerful microcontroller because of its in system self programmable flash on a monolithic chip
  -provides a high flexible and cost effective solution to many embedded control applications.

 ## Controlling the motor's speed

In our circuit we can control the speed of the motor by two different ways, the first way was through change (half / full) cycle switch and the second way was through change the potentiometer slider place and we can use the two ways in same time. the two ways have different techniques to change speed which :

- **(half / full) cycle switch :** change the speed of the motor only in two modes the full cycle and the half cycle mode , and it can be achieved by making two arrays of steps and by using one of them with the stepper motor it will step corresponding to the selected array and the array selected according to the (half / full) cycle switch.
 ```
STEPS  DB        00000011B,              ; Full Step Mode Array
                 00000110B, 
                 00001100B, 
                 00001001B   

HSTEPS DB        00000001B,      	       ; Half Step Mode Array
                 00000011B, 
                 00000010B, 
                 00000110B, 
                 00000100B, 
                 00001100B, 
                 00001000B,
                 00001001B
 ``` 
- **the Potentiometer Slider :** in this way we control the position of Motor (rotation angle) by changing the position of the potentiometer slider , there are 4 values we can obtain through the Potentiometer by using ADC converter to convert the analog value of the potentiometer to digital value, the result will be subtracted from current position, and the reminder of result divided by 4 will be the control value that will determine the active mode.
